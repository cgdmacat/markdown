  - `Email`: The user's email address.
  - `Enabled`: Indicates whether the user is active (true/false).
- **Features**:
  - **Sorting**: Users can sort data by clicking on column headers.
  - **Filtering**: Filter icons next to each column allow refined data searches.

## Page Behavior
1. **Adding a New User**:
   - Clicking the "New User" button clears the form and allows new entries.
   - All fields must be completed for validation.
   - Clicking "Save User" adds the new user to the table.

2. **Editing an Existing User**:
   - Selecting a user from the table populates the form with their details.
   - After editing, clicking "Save User" updates the user's information.

3. **Sorting and Filtering in the Table**:
   - Clicking column headers sorts the data (ascending/descending).
   - Filters allow narrowing down results by column values.

4. **Hide Disabled Users**:
   - Checking the "Hide Disabled User" option removes inactive users from the table display.

## Developer Notes
- **Validation**:
  - Ensure all mandatory fields are validated before saving.
  - Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Responsiveness**:
  - The UI should be responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Include ARIA labels for better screen reader support.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle errors like duplicate usernames, missing fields, or invalid email formats gracefully.
